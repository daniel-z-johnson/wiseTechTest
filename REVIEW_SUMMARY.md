# Code Review Summary for index.js

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to `index.js` following a comprehensive code review. All changes maintain backward compatibility while improving error handling, validation, and user experience.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Poor Error Handling
**Problem**: The main catch block only logged "An error occurred" without details.
**Solution**: Enhanced error logging to show actual error messages and API response data.

### 2. Missing Validation
**Problem**: Code assumed API responses always had expected structure.
**Solution**: Added validation for payment options, exchange rates, and fee data.

### 3. Environment Setup
**Problem**: No guidance for setting up required environment variables.
**Solution**: Created `.env.example` with clear setup instructions.

### 4. Unsafe Data Access
**Problem**: Direct property access without null checks could cause crashes.
**Solution**: Added defensive programming throughout critical sections.

## Key Improvements

1. **Robust Error Handling**: Better error messages with specific details
2. **Input Validation**: Parameter validation for critical functions
3. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Handles missing optional data elegantly
4. **Setup Documentation**: Clear environment setup guidance
5. **Type Safety**: Better validation of expected data types
